As youâ€™ve probably read on the landing page, Iâ€™m no longer using this website, together with the Hugo-Framework.

Itâ€™s not because I donâ€™t like Hugo â€” on the contrary, Hugo is very easy to use.
I just wanted to learn more, so I switched to [Astro](https://astro.build/), which includes modern JS frameworks.

However, if you want a simple static website, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - especially together with the [Blowfish-Theme](https://blowfish.page/) will definitively serve your needs.
